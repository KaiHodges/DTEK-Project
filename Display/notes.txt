Playing grid is 10 blocks wide and 20 blocks tall, screen is 240 pixels high so each square is 240/20 = 12 pixels, so 12x12.

To have the grid centered the offset has to be (320-120)/2 = 100 pixels on both sides. This space should be used to show the currently held piece and possibly the upcoming ones too. Maybe a little display of controls or something idk
